    "'''Report on Bicycle-Sharing System Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "The bike sharing system has become more and more popular in many cities around the world as a convenient, affordable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. This report analyzes a database containing information about bicycle trips in a bicycle sharing system. The database contains 6,867 bicycle trips per day and includes information such as trip ID, start and end times, and start and end locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Description:\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "• trip_id: A unique identifier for each bicycle trip.\n",
    "• started_at: The start time of the trip.\n",
    "• ended_at: The end time of the trip.\n",
    "• start_lat/start_lng: The latitude/longitude coordinates of the starting depot.\n",
    "• end_lat/end_lng: The latitude/longitude coordinates of the end depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "The database provides valuable information on usage patterns of bike sharing systems. A preliminary analysis of the database revealed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum duration of the trip (in minutes): 532.0\n",
    "Minimum duration of the trip (in minutes): 1.1\n",
    "Total number of trips corresponding to the minimum duration: 282\n",
    "Percentage of total circular trips: 2.3776425744025805\n",
    "Total runtime for the function: 0.09648387336730957 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Results:\n",
    "In summary, this report analyzes a database containing bicycle trip data in a bicycle sharing system. The analysis provides valuable insight into system usage patterns, including average trip duration, distance per trip, and popular start and end locations. These insights can help bike-sharing system operators optimize their operations, such as distributing bikes to high-demand locations to improve the overall user experience.'''"
